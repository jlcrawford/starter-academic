In general, people tend to avoid engaging in cognitively effortful activities. This tendency is often exacerbated in older adults despite the hypothesized benefits of cognitively effortful activities in helping to promote cognitive health and well-being in older age. My work is aimed at studying the subjective value that participants place on performing cognitively effortful activities and how this differs across different domains. In parallel, I have studied cognitive effort outside of the lab using Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) to be able to better characterize the contexts and temporal dynamics that support cognitive effort-based decision making across the adult life span.
