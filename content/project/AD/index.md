Early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are associated with both tau pathology in the monoaminergic nuclei and subtle behavioral changes in affect, motivation, and cognition. My research combines in vivo assessments of monoamine systems and AD pathology with intensive longitudinal sampling of daily life activities, experiences, and cognition to better understand the relationships between the brain and behavior in aging and preclinical AD.
